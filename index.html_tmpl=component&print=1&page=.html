		<p>In many areas of science, simulations and experiments begin to generate many petabytes of data, with some sciences facing exabytes of data near term. Similarly, the collection of information about the Internet applications and users for a variety of purposes is generating only more data. Our ability to manage, mine, analyze, and visualize the data is fundamental to the knowledge discovery process. That is, the value of data at extreme scale can be fully realized only if we have an end-to-end solution, which demands a collective, inter-disciplinary effort to develop.</p>
<p>This new symposium, held in conjunction with IEEE Vis 2013, aims at bringing together domain scientists, data analytics and visualization researchers, and users, and fostering the needed exchange to develop the next-generation data-intensive analysis and visualization technology. Attendees will be introduced to the latest and greatest research innovations in large data management, analysis, and visualization, learn how these innovations impact data intensive computing and knowledge discovery, and also learn about the critical issues in creating a complete solution through both invited and contributed talks, and panel discussion. Paper submissions are solicited for a long paper event that describes large data visualization techniques and systems, and a short paper event for practitioners to describe and present their large data visualization applications. Topic emphasis is on algorithms, languages, systems and hardware that supports the analysis and visualization of large data.</p>
<p>There are a variety of ways to participate in LDAV 2013 - papers, posters, and attending. We hope to see you there!</p>
<h2>Registration</h2>
<p>Registration for LDAV is handled through the IEEE Vis 2013 registration system. Just click through to the <a href="http://ieeevis.org/year/2013/info/registration/conference-registration">VisWeek registration page</a>, and register for one or two days, or the entire week.</p>
<p>LDAV would like to thank our sponsors for making this year's symposium a success!</p>
